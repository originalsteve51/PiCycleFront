# PiCycleFront
The front (handlebar) unit of a bicycle control panel based on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. 

See the PiCycleRear readme for an overall description of this entire project.

The front unit provides a dashboard for the cyclist. There are five LEDs here to show the rider when turn signals are 
in use and when the brake is signalled.

Signalling is done by using a special multi-function switch originally made for use on a Moped.

Initially there is only a rear-facing signal. Eventually the front us=nit will be fitted up with a front signal.
